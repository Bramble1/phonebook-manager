# notes

This is only a very quick prototype, all the core features work. However there is not error checking such as making sure the user entered a string correctly, error
checking to see if a function executes correctly etc. This is a quick prototype created in 1 day, to prove to the employer that i can quickly learn new technologies and programming languages. And eager to become a python developer. I haven't used python since i was 11, and this quick project was to prove i can work in limited time to learn and adjust to new languages and technology i haven't used in a while, or not at all.
